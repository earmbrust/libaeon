/**
  \page obtain Obtaining
  \section obtaining Obtaining the source code
  There are two ways to download the source code to libaeon.

  \subsection sfnetdl Downloading from sourceforge.net
  The first way, and most common, is to download a source tarball from
  a sourceforge mirror.  This is the easiest, and most stable, method
  for implementing libaeon.  However, you may not see the most recent
  changes to the library in a source tarball.  That aside, source
  tarballs are generally considered more stable than other methods.

  <em>To download libaeon, visit http://libaeon.sourceforge.net/</em>

  \subsection sfnightly Downloading nightly tarballs
  Another common way to obtain libaeon is through nightly tarball
  releases.  These are more up to date (generally) than the release
  tarballs, but are done automatically, which means that the code may
  or may not work properly.

  <em>Visit http://libaeon.sourceforge.net/download.html to download
  a nightly tarball.</em>

/**
  \page unpack Unpacking
  \section unpack Unpacking the source
  Depending on your distribution/OS, unpacking the source distribution may vary.

  \subsection tarbz2 Unpacking from a bzipped tarball
  If you downloaded the gzipped tarball (.tar.gz) then you will most likely
  want to extract the file as such:
  \code
  tar -xvjf libaeon-x.xx.xx.tar.bz2
  \endcode
  \subsection targz Unpacking from a gzipped tarball
  If you downloaded the gzipped tarball (.tar.gz) then you will most likely
  want to extract the file as such:
  \code
  tar -xvzf libaeon-x.xx.xx.tar.gz
  \endcode
  \subsection zip Unpacking from a zipped file set
  If you downloaded the zipped fileset (.zip) then you will most likely
  want to extract the file as such:
  \code
  unzip libaeon-x.xx.xx.zip
  \endcode

  Back to \ref obtain

  Continue to \ref build

/**
  \page build Building
  \section preconfigure Generating the configure script
  If you have downloaded the source from the CVS or SVN repositories, then
  you should first create the necessary files by using autotools, or by
  using the included autogen.sh script.
  To do so, simply change directories to the source tree and run the script
  as such:
  \code
  cd ./libaeon-0.16.15/
  ./autogen.sh
  \endcode

  \section configure Configuring for building
  Before building the library, you must configure it to work on your
  system.  To do so, you must run the configure script that was either
  included in your package, or built by the autogen script.

  To configure the source code for compilation, run the script as so:
  \code
  ./configure
  \endcode

  \section compile Compiling the library
  Once you have completed running the configure script, it's time to
  compile the code.  On most Linux/UNIX systems, it would simply be:
  \code
  make
  \endcode

  This should compile the code into a library file, ready for use.
  To install the library system-wide afer compilation, you should use:
  \code
  make install
  \endcode
